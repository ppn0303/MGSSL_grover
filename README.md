```
To install RDKit, please follow the instructions here http://www.rdkit.org/docs/Install.html

* `motif_based_pretrain/` contains codes for motif-based graph self-supervised pretraining.
* `finetune/` contains codes for finetuning on MoleculeNet benchmarks for evaluation.
## Training
You can pretrain the model by
```
cd motif_based_pretrain
python pretrain_motif.py
```

## Evaluation
You can evaluate the pretrained model by finetuning on downstream tasks
```
cd finetune
python finetune.py
```
